when a lot of requests at the same time


think 

where : 
- coupon 
- bypass limit
- bypass rate limit ( like brute force login pages with turno intruder)
- submit something more then once ( like flag and earn points)
- Race Condition leads to undeletable group member : make your self undeletable by send the accept request (after click the invitation link) a lot of times in short period of time (race condition hhhhhh) .
- invite user already exist , or send them a lot of invitation linke . 
- add item with high price between the checkout of an low price item . ( check portswigger lab multi endpoint race condition ) .
- change email ( send the link ) : teh link will be the same , but you need to see what they accept , if accept victim , click the link of attacker and the victim will be confirmed . 
- invite user ( send the link ) : the link will be the same
- reset password : but maybe you need two different cookie ( see the lab at portswigger)
---

- email confirmation : 
between the full creation of the user , we send the request of confirm email , with no value in the token , because no token is yet generated to that email .

if token=            is forbidden , try token[]=  ( array )

for more info , solve the last lab in portswigge of race condition .
