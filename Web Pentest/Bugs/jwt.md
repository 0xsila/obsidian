A JWT consists of 3 parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. These are each separated by a dot.

some times you need to find the secret using johntheripper ( the end of jwt )

JWE vs JWS : 
JWS : json web signature
JWE : json web encryption

##### jwt headers : 
- `jwk` (JSON Web Key) - Provides an embedded JSON object representing the key.
    
- `jku` (JSON Web Key Set URL) - Provides a URL from which servers can fetch a set of keys containing the correct key.
    
- `kid` (Key ID) - Provides an ID that servers can use to identify the correct key in cases where there are multiple keys to choose from. Depending on the format of the key, this may have a matching `kid` parameter.

# JWT authentication bypass via unverified signature : 

just change the role or something , easy beasy


# JWT authentication bypass via flawed signature verification : 

go to token dev (website)
change the role to admin
remove the Signing key
change the algorithm to none
add . in the end of the token

# Brute force the secret key : 

usning hashcat
