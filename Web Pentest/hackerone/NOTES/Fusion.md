#### Project : 



---
#### Ideas : 

manager add someone as a admin
manager downgrad all admins

Hub settings => add members

Automatic approval => with specified domain 

add the domainin the name of another email domain => bom

play with this function : ![[Pasted image 20250809141148.png]]


---
if it informative , think to :
normal admin downgrad hime self , and still other admins
downgrade them now

---

### # Bug 1 : 
no permission see users and ther roles , get the id of the user from the request , go to other endpoint and get user data by id => bom*

---
###  # Bug 2 : 
archive project still be accessed by the project owner => think in a scenrario

race condition to bypass 15 user limit in hub

they use captcha token , try to get 18 captcha token , and send them in group and see the result

race condition in fuckin recaptcha token , in the last request , use the same recaptcha token and try to bypass them both in the same time ( recaptcha usage + limit of users )

---

manager add inactive users to a project , maybe will be activated 

it very possible 

when i try it , the error was about invalid recaptcha token , not about limit 

now undertsand the recaptcha token clearly , and see how much time is need to be invalid

it was fuckin hard work , thanks , and be proud even not accepted

**Editable files limit in free/private-use tier**: In a Fusion Team hub without a paid subscription (e.g., for personal use), you can have **only up to 10 editable files at a time**. You can still have more projects overall, but older ones need to be switched to **read-only** to open new ones as editable[](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fusion360/comments/1ehh630/4_projects_take_up_the_10_limit_i_have_and_i_cant/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

| **Project** |        |               |        |               |         |         |
|    **User** |        |               |        |               |         |         |

amazing Bug : 

dos of project by change the role of the owner to any another role 


admin change the role of owner to anything => dos

---


By default, a new project is secret. Only you and hub administrators have access to a project you create.

transfer the project.
idea : 

hub user can see new projects

If you promote someone with Project Contributor access to the role of Project Administrator, they will not be able to create groups or transfer the project.

PC can not create a group ( if he is an admin )
but he can invite a user , the user will be by default Hub user => 
give him admin role in project => create group

Pc invite a Pc 


PC < Hub member 

PC can invite user to a project => automaticly => Hub member


---


enforce html injection in hub name 

by 1 parameter empty

the other payload


---

hub member can not invite users to the HUB
but if he is a manager in a project => he can invite users to the project ,
but wait , the invited user to the project is automaticly added as a hub mmember in the Hub 

where is the logic

a manager can invite 15 user to the project => 15 user to the HUB => hub is limited

no delete function , even we disabled the user , we can not invite other users


i dont think atht its a bug
